# rpi-redis
[Redis](http://redis.io) is an open source, BSD licensed, advanced key-value cache and store. It is often referred to as a data structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps and hyperloglogs.

This version is designed to run in a Docker instance on a Raspberry Pi. 
The Dockerfile was shamelessly borrowed (stolen) from the [Official Redis Docker Image](https://github.com/docker-library/redis/tree/master/3.0).

Docker for the Raspberry Pi as well as Docker friendly debian images can be located [here](http://blog.hypriot.com).
